                    <p class="white">In 2013, Beyoncé stated in an interview with Vogue that she considered herself to be „a modern-day feminist“. She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling „We should all be feminists“, a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song „Flawless“, released later that year. She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls Beyoncé publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California’s Proposition 8. She has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyoncé and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for „Freedom“. In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyoncé responded to the controversy surrounding her song „Formation“ which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, „I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me“.
                        In February 2017, Beyoncé spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump’s presidential administration.</p>
